# Feed Reader Testing using Jasmine

**A Udacity FEND project**

This project demonstrates browser based testing using Jasmine.

**Steps to run**

**_For local run_**

Download the project's zip file [here](https://github.com/Prateek-Tewari/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/archive/master.zip)

- Open index.html in the browser of your choice. It may take some time to completely load as additional network requests are made. Once loaded, test results should be displayed at the bottom of the page.

**_[Online version](https://prateek-tewari.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/)_**

**Note** - The online version might not work as the browser treats js script files unsafe to load. Load those scripts from the extreme right of address bar to carry on.
